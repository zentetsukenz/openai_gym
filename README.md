# OpenAI Gym

This repository is intend to be a place where I keep my machine learning algorithms that try to play with OpenAI Gym.  

There are only Q learning and its variance implementation, Deep Q Learning and Double Deep Q
learning. The algorithm is based on [Google Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://deepmind.com/research/dqn/)  

## Getting Started

Just clone this project and run each gym problem with `python`. This should
start a machine learning based on what is used in the problem file.

### Prerequisites

- Python. I prefer using `pyenv` as an environment control because of its simplicity.  
- Tensorflow. Please follow tensorflow installation guide.
- Keras. Please also follow Keras installation guide but basically, `pip install keras` should be enough with Tensorflow as a backend.  
- Numpy. Lovely math library.  
- Pandas. Build on top of Numpy, this library provide a high level of using Numpy.

## Contributing

I'm new to Python, so no coding style fixed for me yet but PEP8 coding standard is preferred.
